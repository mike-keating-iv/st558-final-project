    "text": "Exploratory Analysis: Socioeconomic Factors\nThere is a wide body of research linking diabetes and socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and race. Diabetes disproportionately effects minorities and those with low socioeconomic status.\nIn this analysis, we will explore the impact of the following variables related to socioeconomic factors.\n\nIncome: A self-reported bracketed income variable (1 = lowest, 8 = highest).\nEducation: An ordinal variable measuring the highest level of education completed (1 = lowest, 6 = highest).\nNoDocbcCost: Indicates whether someone was unable to see a doctor in the past year due to cost (1 = yes, 0 = no).\n\nThese variables are important because lower income and education are known to correlate with higher diabetes risk. Additionally, cost-related barriers to healthcare can delay diagnosis and management of chronic conditions like diabetes.\n\nData Transformation\nFirst, we need to transform our variables of interest that are currently numeric into a factor data type with labels that are easy for us to understand.\n\n# Reassign variables of interest into factors with meaningful labels\n# Labels were assigned from the codebook\ndiabetes &lt;- diabetes |&gt; \n  mutate(Income = factor(Income, \n                         levels = 1:8, \n                         labels = c(\"LT $10k\", \"$10-15k\", \"$15-20k\", \"$20-25k\", \"$25-35k\",\n                                    \"$35-50k\", \"$50-75k\", \"GT $75k\")),\n         Education = factor(Education,\n                            levels = 1:6,\n                            labels = c(\"None\", \"Elementary\", \"Some HS\", \"HS Graduate\", \n                                       \"Some College\", \"College Graduate\")),\n         NoDocbcCost = factor(NoDocbcCost,\n                              levels = 0:1,\n                              labels = c(\"No Barrier\", \"Cost Barrier\")),\n         Diabetes_binary = factor(Diabetes_binary,\n                                  levels = 0:1,\n                                  labels = c(\"Nondiabetic\", \"Diabetic\"))) |&gt;\n  select(Diabetes_binary, Income, Education, NoDocbcCost)\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics\n\ndiabetes |&gt; summary()\n\n    Diabetes_binary       Income                 Education     \n Nondiabetic:218334   GT $75k:90385   None            :   174  \n Diabetic   : 35346   $50-75k:43219   Elementary      :  4043  \n                      $35-50k:36470   Some HS         :  9478  \n                      $25-35k:25883   HS Graduate     : 62750  \n                      $20-25k:20135   Some College    : 69910  \n                      $15-20k:15994   College Graduate:107325  \n                      (Other):21594                            \n       NoDocbcCost    \n No Barrier  :232326  \n Cost Barrier: 21354  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n\n\n\nIncome\n\n# Plot diabetes with income\ndiabetes |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Income, fill = Diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of Diabetes by Income Bracket\", y = \"Proportion\", fill = \"Diabetes\") +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_fill_few() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, we can see a clear trend of decreasing rates of diabetes as income increases.\n\n\nEducation\n\ndiabetes |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = Education, fill = Diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of Diabetes by Education Level\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill=\"Diabetes\") +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_fill_few() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost Barrier for Treatment"
